# 📊 HR Dashboard – Power BI

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project visualizes employee data through an interactive Power BI **HR Dashboard**, helping HR managers and business leaders monitor workforce trends, attrition, performance, and key HR metrics.

The dashboard gives clarity on hiring, turnover, salary structure, employee satisfaction, and demographic analyses — making complex HR data actionable.

## 🎯 Key Business Questions

- How is the employee headcount evolving over time?
- Which departments have the highest attrition?
- What employee segments (age, tenure, salary) have the greatest retention risk?
- How do performance and compensation relate to attrition?

## 📌 Core Metrics (KPIs)

- **Total Active Employees**
- **Attrition Rate (%)**
- **New Hires**
- **Average Tenure**
- **Average Salary**
- **Training Hours per Employee**

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

1. **Headcount & Turnover Trends** – Identify hiring and separation trends.
2. **Demographics** – Age, gender, department, and role distributions.
3. **Attrition Analysis** – Compare attrition by department, job role, and tenure.
4. **Performance & Engagement** – Explore performance ratings, satisfaction levels, and their impact on retention.
5. **Interactive Slicers & Drilldowns** – Filter visuals by timeframe, department, and employee group.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard design & interactivity
- **Power Query** – Data transformation
- **DAX** – Advanced measures & KPIs
- **Custom Slicers & Drillthroughs** – For interactive storytelling

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations

- Employees with lower training hours tend to show higher performance gaps.
- Salary bands below the median correlate with higher turnover risk.

## 📈 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Use slicers to filter by timeframe, department, or job role.
